# Introduction to R for Econometrics

Here you can find an R script that you can download and execute on your computer, so that you can start familiarizing with the basic functions you need to perform econometric analysis with R.

There is a lot of text in the script that will guide you through each line of code. If you read it carefully you will encounter no problems :)
